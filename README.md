# Partner Reference Application Extension 'Catering Management'

## Description

In the dynamic landscape of multi-tenant SaaS applications, extensibility is crucial for success. While standardized cloud software offers efficiency and regular updates, it often can't address every customer's unique needs, industry-specific requirements, or regulatory demands. When one customer requires a specialized feature, it's impractical to modify the core product for all users. Moreover, businesses need the flexibility to integrate with existing systems, innovate on top of standard solutions, and rapidly adapt to changing market conditions—all while maintaining a cost-effective approach that preserves the ability to receive regular software updates. This is where tenant-specific extensions become invaluable.

The Partner Reference Application Extension repository demonstrates how to achieve this crucial flexibility by extending the [Poetry Slam Manager](https://github.com/SAP-samples/partner-reference-application.git) with enhanced catering management capabilities. By leveraging the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), this extension acts as a "golden path" for partners. It enables partners to build extensions that address the unique needs of individual customers while preserving the core application's functionality for other tenants and adhering to SAP standards for scalability, security, and enterprise readiness.

It showcases the platform's flexibility and extensibility with features such as:

- Seamless integration with the base application,
- Granular tenant-specific configurations to deliver personalized experiences,
- Consistent user experience across extended and core functionality,
- Secure multi-tenant architecture, ensuring data isolation and performance scalability.

#### Overview of Partner Reference Application

[Partner Reference Application](https://github.com/SAP-samples/partner-reference-application.git) repository provides you with a “golden path” to becoming a SaaS provider of 
multi-tenant applications based on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). The guidance covers building, running, and integrating scalable full-stack cloud applications.
It includes an ERP-agnostic design that lets you deliver your application as a side-by-side extension to consumers using any SAP solution, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Business One,
and SAP Business ByDesign

### About the Sample Extension _Catering Management_

Imagine you are an event manager at Gourmet Poetry, a company renowned for organizing high-profile poetry slams that seamlessly blend spoken word artistry with gourmet catering experiences.

While the base Poetry Slam Manager (PSM) application helps you manage events and attendees, you face additional complexities in selecting, tracking, and coordinating with caterers for your events.

Here the event manager has to organize the catering for the event registered in the "Poetry Slam Manager" app to manage the poetry slams using the extension provided by the partner to manage the catering services.

</p>

While Gourmet Poetry views catering as an essential component of their events, other customers may not require this functionality. The extension is designed to accommodate both scenarios seamlessly,
enabling tenant-specific configurations without disrupting the core application's functionality for other users.

This story highlights:

- The flexibility of multi-tenant architecture, ensuring optional features like catering can be enabled per tenant.
- The power of SAP BTP extensions to address niche business needs without impacting core functionality.
- An innovative example of blending technology with the art of event management in the culinary and poetry domains.

The Catering Management Extension provides:

1. Dedicated UI for Caterer Management:
    - Manage a directory of preferred caterers with details such as contact information, cuisine specialties, and pricing.
    - Search, filter, and select caterers based on event requirements.
    - Integration with Poetry Slam Events:

2. Assign caterers to specific events and manage catering logistics directly in the application.

This extension ensures a unified experience for managing both poetry slams and gourmet catering, allowing you to elevate event quality while streamlining operational workflows.
